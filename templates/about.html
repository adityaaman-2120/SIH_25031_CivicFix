<h2>About CivicFix</h2>
<p>CivicFix is a platform to streamline reporting of civic issues such as open manholes, broken pipes, garbage collection problems, and non-functional street lights.</p>
<p>Our goal is to connect citizens with the nearest municipal authority and provide a transparent workflow from reporting to resolution.</p>
